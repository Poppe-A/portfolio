      I'm a french junior{' '}
      <span className='underline'>fullstack developper</span> who live in
      Nantes. After studying and working in electronics, i felt the need to find
      something different. Something in line with my values and interests.{' '}
      <br />
      <br />I was really interested in developpement for a long time, that i
      discovered through <strong>digital art</strong> and <strong>DIY</strong>,
      so i spent some time learning it, and it finaly leaded me to
      <strong>Web developpement</strong>.<br />
      <br />I did a three month web dev course at Ecole central de Nantes (a
      POEI), then i worked for two years in a company.
      <br />
      Now, i'm back again to school (Wild Code School of Nantes) to improve and
      update my skills, and to do what I like the most : discovering new things
      ! I'm also a guitar player in a band in Nantes.
